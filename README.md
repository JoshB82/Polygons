# Polygons

Ever wondered about the properties of your favourite polygons? No? Well, you're missing out.

**Polygons** is a simple and easy-to-use web-app that displays the properties of any polygon you draw. It does all the maths for you and gives you the numbers with no fuss.

You can easily create the vertices of your polygon with a double-click and move them around by clicking and dragging. The calculations will automatically update on the right-hand side of your screen. Click "Clear screen" to start again or click "Create new co-ordinate" enter a new polygon vertex directly.

Let's look at an example:

Say you have this complicated looking polygon and you need to know its area. Don't bring out the calculator - let the web browser do all the work for you!
